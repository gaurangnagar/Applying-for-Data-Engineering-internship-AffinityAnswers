AffinityAnswers-Assessment-Degree of profanity
Program that can indicate the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file.

Assumptions made:

Comments are contained in a text file with each comment on a new line.

The file key words is the list of words containing racial slurs.

Working:

The comments file is opened and the comments are read into a list. The list consists of comments which are tokenized before they are checked with a list of words containing racial slurs. If a match is found, the counter is incremented and the degree of profanity is calculated for that comment.
